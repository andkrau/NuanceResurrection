License Agreement
=================
The latest official distribution of Nuance was always to be obtained from 
the nuon-emu.com FTP site.  Nowadays it's on https://github.com/andkrau/NuanceResurrection/
The emulator may not be redistributed for profit
by itself or as part of any other package.   Redistribution of the official
distribution package is allowed via HTTP or FTP under the restriction that the
official distribution package is not modified in any way.  In particular, no
advertisements, .nfo files, readme files or bookmarks may be added to the
distribution package under any circumstances.

Note that any source changes that were/are done by the open source contributors (i.e. NOT by
the original author Mike Perry, so everything that was commited AFTER the initial source release) are available under

Over time we will try to get everything of the source base to apply to BSD3,
but this will be a longer process.
